Version 1.0

About:
  - Blackjack is a card game to reach 21. If a player goes over, then he "busts" and loses
  - In my version of Blackjack, it will be a one-player game against the computer (dealer).
  - The player starts with $10 and can wager however much they want
  - A player earns more if they get blackjack on the first dealing
  - There is no limit to how much you can win! Have fun!

Future features:
  - add split feature (if a user starts with two of the same cards, then allow to split and play those individually)
  - 2-player mode by adding Player classes
